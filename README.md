# 🌵 Hi, I'm Cataline

### A full stack developer passionate about solving problems & writing clean code

👩‍💻 I’m currently working on a productivity app with a [React front end](https://github.com/ctln12/react-timed-task-tracker) & a [Rails back end](https://github.com/ctln12/rails-timed-task-tracker-api)

🌱 I’m also growing my skills in [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [RSpec](https://rspec.info/)

🔭 I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful projects that improve people's lives

📫 Reach me at **catalinebaert@yahoo.com**

🧘‍♀️ I regularly practice [meditation](https://www.petitbambou.com/en/), [yoga](https://www.downdogapp.com/) or [qi gong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fADrBXkVruY)

⚡ Fun facts: I'm desperately fond of [The X-Files](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/) TV show & [cacti](https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/garden/plants/news/a295/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-cacti/)!
